## üß† Core Challenges & Solutions

### 1. **Concurrent Transfers**
**Problem:** Multiple transfers might target the same account at the same time, risking race conditions.

### 2. **Duplicate Requests (Idempotency)**
**Problem:** A merchant might retry a transfer due to a network hiccup or timeout, causing double-debits.  

---

### 3. **Network Hiccups & Partial Failures**
**Problem:** The network might fail mid-transfer, leaving the system in an unknown state.  


---

### 4. **System Overload**
**Problem:** Merchants might push too many transfer requests in a short time.

Benefits of DbContext Pooling:
Reduced Overhead: By reusing DbContext instances, you reduce the cost associated with creating and disposing of DbContext objects.
Improved Performance: Pooling can lead to better performance in high-traffic applications by reducing the time spent on DbContext initialization and disposal.
Efficient Resource Utilization: Pooling helps in efficient utilization of resources, especially in scenarios where DbContext instances are frequently created and disposed of.
